These scripts belong to a final project for the course "Biological Databases and Data Analysis Tools" by Dr. Yeşim Aydın Son and Dr. Levent Çarkacıoğlu at Informatics Institute, Middle East Technical University in 2013.

The project is about getting to know Biomart Ensembl, retrieving data from it and merging the data with an existing data and then developing a user interface that enables user to search for the data.

It's written in PHP and with the help of jQuery, search and data retrieval were made simple by AJAX.
